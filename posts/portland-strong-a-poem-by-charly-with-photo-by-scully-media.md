Portland Strong

The drums of the revolution have been sounding loud
                for hours, for days, for years unbowed

Dancing, and chanting, there is joy in using our voices
                Drums and blocks, horns, and a boombox

A subtle move goes through the crowd 
                goggles on, mask on, shield up, we will not be cowed

Do you have the lawyer's number?
               They will come for you in the gutter

Write it on your arm, write it on your body
               here, let me help you sweetie

With no warning at all
              the tear gas falls

It will rise buildings tall
                the wall advances to cover us all

We retreat, we pull back
                 retch and hack

Wash the eyes, check for wounds 
                medics are here, no one is marooned

Sounding clear through the gas attack
                the drums and trumpet call us back 

The phalanx advances through the mist 
               Portland is pissed

The Rose City will continue to resist, despite the danger 
            because Black Lives will always Matter
