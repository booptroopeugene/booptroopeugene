**The stakes**

**have never**

**been**

**so high.**

**It sounds**

**cliched,**

**but who can deny?**

**Every generation has its moment —**

**“Ism”s are endemic.**

**But now, they all foment**

**Amid global pandemic**

**and disintegration**

**of entire ecosystems.**

**Every day,**

**another symptom.**

**We’ve fought genocide before,**

**in World War Two,**

**and made it stop.**

**But there are ecocidal tipping points,**

**and we are way past the top.**

**We**

**can’t**

**breathe–**

**Not when police are killing us.**

**Not when our next breath could be**

**a ticking time bomb, 2 weeks hence.**

**Not when ecological protections**

**Are being undone by Trump and Pence.**

**Which will kill us first? Genocide? Ecocide?**

**I hate sitting in suspense.**

**We can no longer**

**countenance**

**those still sitting**

**on the fence.**

**Time to make a stand.**

**Feels like “end times” are at hand.**

**I really would have enjoyed feeling safe to live a long life.**

**That luxury would have been grand.**

**Now, sometimes, that chance feels blown away,**

**like a beach’s random bit of sand.**

**Our vision is clear.**

**We see through the lies.**

**Only in collective activity**

**to revolutionize**

**are we likely to see**

**a community**

**able to live to be**

**old and wise.**
