**What does community taste like?**

**Nothing acrid in the air,**

**finding a security buddy,**

**with whom to be a trusting pair.**

**A bit like donated pizza,**

**and pastries hand-baked with flair,**

**to stock the block or the rally.**

**Many ways to show we care.**

**Render bitter racists unelectable.**

**Bring their rancid policies to defeat.**

**Carry on, stirringly,**

**until victory is sweet.**

**The most delectable flavor**

**we can currently savor or chug**

**is being together at a rally,**

**a big astral group hug.**
