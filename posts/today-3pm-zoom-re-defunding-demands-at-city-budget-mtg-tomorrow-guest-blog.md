If you can’t make it and did research that you’d like to share with the group, feel free to call me or email me a summary of what you’ve learned. My number is (415)328-0624.\
AGENDA:\
-Intros\
-Gracie reports on budget policy doc.\
-Martin report on Black Unity and what they would like to add to this conversation\
-Tim report on CAHOOTS and Whitebird and what they would like to add to this conversation\
-Kory report on Community Safety Initiative\
-Chelsea report on a summarization of the racist history of Oregon\
-Aria report on\
-Janna report on Police Auditor\
-Rachel report on\
-Jacqueline report on previous police auditor\
-Ali report on the Eugene Police Union\
-Tiffany report on City Manager\
-Time for other attendees to add what they have learned about the EPD and city decision making.\
-Plan for our speeches in the council meeting on Monday\
I assume most of us will speak on the topic we did research on. Some of you who do not feel comfortable speaking can pass your research to someone who does.\
The main goals of our speeches:\
-demand 30% of the police budget be allocated to CAHOOTS, Whitebird and other upstream solutions.\
-CAHOOTS needs their own dispatch line\
-Raise wages for CAHOOTS employees to that of Police Officers\
-Allocate money to creating low barrier shelters and places for an increased CAHOOTS force to bring people in crisis\
-Demand the Council and City Manager commit to re-evaluating their budgeting principles which have been stagnant for 12 years\
-Demand police accountability with their disciplinary actions, body cam footage and De-escalation policy\
-Speak to the racist history of Oregon\
-Bring to light specific cases in which the police have acted with brutality and threatened the well being of our community:\
Specific Cases include:\
-Ayisha Brown and her son\
-Eliborio Rodriguez\
-Tear gas and rubber bullets used on civilians in the first BLM protests in Eugene this year\
-Magana, and Lara (officers fired in 2003-2004 for repeated sexual offensives against women with criminal records)\
-Demand the city council plan an extensive Supplemental Budget that addresses our community’s demands for defunding the police and building a robust and sustainable example out of the CAHOOTS program that can be an example for the rest of the country.\
I appreciate all of you and the more I learn about the city and the EPD, the more logical and straightforward defunding EPD seems. I believe that if we coordinate, the council will feel the same way. That is my hope!\
Sincerely,\
Gracie
