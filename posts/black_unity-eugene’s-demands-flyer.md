I personally very strongly support completely demilitarizing Eugene Police Department.

Not only do I fully support redirecting any funds that would have been allocated for additional militarized / crowd control supplies, to CAHOOTS; I additionally personally support ensuring that no militarized gear is accepted for free, either.

Stay tuned to Boop Troop Eugene News Blog for a future article on that subject.
