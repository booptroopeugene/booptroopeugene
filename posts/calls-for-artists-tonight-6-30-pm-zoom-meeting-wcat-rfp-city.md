In addition to, of course, being welcome and sought for BoopTroopEugene News’ blog, artists from BIPOC communities and BLM movements are welcome and sought for some forthcoming art projects, in a variety of media. **Tonight, at 6:30 pm, by Zoom, is one of many opportunities to plug in. Zoom details will be at the bottom of this post. WCAT has been approached by people seeking to organize a BLM-themed street painting and/or mural, and we** *(I am a member)* **will be talking about that at tonight’s meeting. Proposals are always welcome.**

Whiteaker Community Art Team (WCAT). WCAT is a subcommittee empowered by the Whiteaker Community Council. We host a wide variety of art content in our neighborhood, which is one of the most diverse in Eugene, as well as a center point for many of the services for our unhoused neighbors. We sponsor the Last Friday Art Walk, which this year we are proposing to host virtually. If our proposal is accepted, we will be able to fund artists in a variety of media, who live, work, or show art in the Whiteaker, to: host virtual tours of their studios; host digital workshops of their art, craft, or healing modality; and/or to participate in live art installations in our neighborhood. We sponsor the Free Walls, a new one of which we are presently in the process of getting built, which 24-7 public spaces for free expression, such as graffiti or spray paint murals. We have sponsored muralists and painters for urban beautification projects, such as decorating traffic boxes.

We meet by Zoom, Monday nights, 6:30 pm, and anyone is welcome. **Tonight, we are going to open the conversation to any ways that we may be of service toward BLM-themed public art projects. Art for therapeutic expression, art for empowerment, art for education, art as a means of public education, these are our passions. We often apply for grants and are here to help.**

Anyone is welcome and sought to join WCAT. All our projects are oriented around highlighting artists from marginalized communities. Here is the link to our Facebook page.

**Among the grant opportunities we will be exploring is this RFP (request for proposals) for public art from the city.**
