Personally, while I think it is certainly more encouraging that the City Manager authorized the permit and chose to make her public profile picture indicative of support of BLM than if her profile picture had a Confederate flag or a MAGA hat, if this same City Manager authorized the manipulative and belatedly announced “curfews” and the repeated and militarized response of EPD to peaceful protestors, and if she did not publicly apologize and denounce the violence afterwards, then there is a lot more than a photo op that we need to see.
