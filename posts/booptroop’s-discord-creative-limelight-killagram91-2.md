"I ain’t who I used to be

Greasing these bars fluently

Touching the sky while I cry

Why do babies have to die?

Instinctual priorities and the chronic abuse of so-called minorities, by so-called authorities Makes me sick,

Troubles seem endless

While I’m fully suspended

An involuntary termination of my life as I know it

Truth be told,

I’m feeling very old I see the structure of this society

Trying to fulfill my role and identity

And time keeps going With no slowing down It’s time to march forth

And renew the whole town"
