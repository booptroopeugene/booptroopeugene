      Dear District Attorney Freeman,

      I am contacting you today to demand justice for George Floyd who was brutally murdered by those who swore to protect him. As a concerned citizen, I demand the immediate charge of Derek Chauvin, Tuo Thao, and all other officers involved in this grisly killing. Their inaction proved to be as deadly as Chauvin’s actions.

      When you took office you swore to protect all victims of crimes in Minneapolis. George Floyd is the victim of a most heinous crime. His life was cut short as he was denied every liberty bestowed upon him as an American citizen. Due process, the right to seek justice, and the right to live, all stolen from him by a public servant.

      Now, as you face the crossroads of this important decision, I trust you will make the right choice and bring charges against those officers who wrongfully and willfully murdered George Floyd on that fateful day. George Floyd deserves justice and you can deliver it. You must deliver it.

      Regards,

      Your name

      ***Future Boop Troop Eugene blog posts will include comparable lists of (a) bail funds; (b) groups accepting donations; (c) anti-racist self-education suggested steps. Remember: Anyone of any age, any health consideration, and any housing or socioeconomic status can and is welcome to participate and be a valid, honored member of activist communities. Yes we need and love those who can be there and live-stream, and those who can be there and march. And, there are meaningful roles for those who cannot. This blog will continue to highlight both. We love you all! –Ellen.***
