For Juneteenth yesterday, with a permit from the City of Eugene, local BIPOC artists and activists had painted Black Lives Matter in front of our federal courthouse, in yellow paint with black hand prints.

Last night, between 9:45 pm and 10:34 pm, someone committed a hate crime to deliberately deface this beautiful and powerful and important statement.

One person posted on Facebook having witnessed “an orange charger with black racing stripes”.

It is likely repainting will occur soon.

Stay tuned. Stay safe. We love you. *–Ellen for Boop Troop Eugene News Blog.*
