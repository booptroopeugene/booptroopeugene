Yesterday on Juneteenth, and in sharp contrast to the overt white supremacism here, the European Union Parliament formally declared, “Black Lives Matter,” in a denunciation of racism and white supremacy, in the EU and the US. They also specifically decried the racist police murder of George Floyd, in a symbolic resolution brought by Renew Europe. The measure passed 493 to 104.

Renew Europe is also pressing for the formation of an EU-wide code of ethics for police.
