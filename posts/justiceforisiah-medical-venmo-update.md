\#JusticeforIsiah echoed throughout downtown Eugene tonight as hundreds of peaceful demonstrators circled the jail where the white male who perpetrated a vicious vehicular assault hate crime at a peaceful Black_Unity event was due to have been incarcerated. Yet the driver, whom multiple witnesses have repeatedly testified in live media aggressively tried to mow into peaceful participants in a KIDS’ MARCH, mostly kids under the age of 8, and who sped up to 15-20 miles per hour to hit their protector, Black_Unity activist Isiah Wagoner, was reportedly only detained briefly, then released and provided with a Springfield Police escort to Springfield (Oregon, USA).

The valiant protector blessedly survived, but was substantively injured, as documented at a hospital to which he was transported by ambulance.

With the affirmed consent of the survivor, we may share that you may donate funds toward his medical expenses by sending to @Isiah-Wagoner on [Venmo.](https://venmo.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds)

To demand the DA honor the survivor’s desire to press charges, write [the District Attorney](mailto:patty.perlow@lanecountyor.gov).
