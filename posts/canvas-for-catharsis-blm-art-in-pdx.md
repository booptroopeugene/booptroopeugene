A canvas for catharsis has emerged at Pioneer Square in downtown Portland, Oregon.

Public art for healing, unity, and action has transformed the boards on the Apple iStore and across from the Louis Vuitton store on SW Yamhill, between SW 4th and 5th Ave in downtown Portland into statements of grief and resolutions to pursue justice.

Black Lives Matter affirmations, and memorials of black individuals of all genders killed by police, feature prominently.

All are welcome to contribute to this ongoing public tribute; paint and chalk are set out on the sidewalk for anyone. Here are additional images from that moving tribute.

The general gestalt of the steadfast movement, determined to persist in the face of repeated repressive tactics, has been projected onto a sky-scraper, as viewed here from the Morrison Bridge:
