**What does community smell like?**

**Well, I’ll tell you what it’s not:**

**the noxious effect of tear gas**

**that fills our masks with snot;**

**the stinging splash of pepper,**

**whether sprayed or shot.**

**For firing those at peaceful protesters,**

**cops should be fired, on the spot.**

**No, it smells like Spring,**

**fresh, blooming things,**

**from group meetings to huge crowds.**

**From a *Boop* of goop**

**to our tremendous *Troop*,**

**raising our voices loud.**

**A whiff of independence**

**and autonomy.**

**A hint of interdependence**

**in groups of affinity.**

**A blend of spicy sentiments,**

**emotions raw, in need of soothing.**

**Determination,**

**activation,**

**motivation,**

**moving.**

**Aroma of our sharing skills,**

**from our medic kits to art.**

**The sweetest flower essence:**

**people bonding from the heart.**
