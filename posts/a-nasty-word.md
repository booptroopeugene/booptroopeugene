A Nasty Word:
So long ago I heard a word.

One I’ve since heard far too many times spoken in ignorance.

This one divisive term has been replayed and replayed

The pain it’s caused, it’s never gone.

Trauma sunk deep into the core of too many souls

Both no here and now goneA ton of terrors 

All associated with this one ugly term that roots evil within

The hearts of men

Rendering them spoiled, useless – committing the worst of sin.There are very real monsters walking amongst you and I.

You would be surprised how many times you’ve looked them in the eye.In the life I’ve lived I sought to know all things to make me reach past the rainbow

A thirst for divinity, if it can be touched, because as I’ve witnessed this world it’s just become all too much.

Some say I use my life now in a manner most vain

But from the moment I was a little girl and first heard a black person called such a name…

I knew that something was darkly wrong with the earth upon which I trod. 

And to that I will happily dedicate my life to a cause

A dream long ago wished for that has seemingly never come to fruition…only been left lingering…on pause…

So open your eyes, pull the wax from your ears…Look around and notice, we can’t breathe…

We’re drowning in our fallen brother and sister’s tears.
