If people in your personal or professional life still doubt or argue against there being a systemic, institutionalized basis for racism in how police brutality and other negative aspects endemic in policing are enacted, here is a tool you can use.

Note that it also lets you filter by factors, such as being able to see how much race of victim correlates with whether charges are brought against the assailing officer.

Here is the source for that data.

Note that this source also provides the following research opportunity:

![killing per population](/static/img/killing-per-population-1-.png)

This is an opportunity to compare data to find the locations with the highest average number of killings by police per one million people, and to then check whether there is any correlation with the percentage of violent crime in the area.

As always, Boop Troop Eugene is here to help empower us to think for ourselves, be our own media, and be our own researchers. Please feel welcome to share here what you discover. We love you. â€“*\-Ellen.*
