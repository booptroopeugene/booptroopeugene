**How has community arisen?**

**What is it like in your dreams?**

**Explore what you’re for; share your visions,**

**For life beyond divisive, racist schemes.**

**Inculcation,**

**Institutions,**

**Violence,**

**Poisoned roots;**

**Branches of devastation**

**Bearing strange fruits….**

**CHOP* them down,**

**Replace them,**

**With autonomous zones.**

**Think outside the box;**

**Make communities our own.**

**All with voice,**

**All with choice,**

**All encouraged, welcomed, rejoiced.**

**Those who’ve been privileged,**

**Stepping aside,**

**Listening and learning,**

**Eyes open wide.**

**Those who oppose,**

**Who chose to misalign,**

**Who collude with violence:**

**It is no longer your time.**

**Never should have been.**

**Never will be again.**

**Statues torn down,**

**Police to be defunded.**

**You bought into oppression?**

**That’s your loss,**

**Won’t be refunded.**

**Community begins**

**Where oppression ends.**

**If you’re here to rebuild,**

**We’re community; we’re friends.**
