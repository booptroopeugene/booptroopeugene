The day it was silent<br>
The sound was turned down<br>
The world it got quiet<br>
Was like a ghost town

I thought I heard something<br>
It sounded of fear<br>
I knew what that sound was<br>
The change it was near

I heard it get louder<br>
It screamed out my name<br>
It was calling to me<br>
To help change the game

I wanted to turn<br>
This wasnâ€™t my fight<br>
I wanted to run<br>
To the left to the right

Straight up ahead<br>
I could see them all kneel<br>
Screaming out names<br>
They just wanted to feel

Emotions ran high<br>
As they protest today<br>
The corrupt system<br>
Attempting to sway

The masses<br>
The people<br>
The forgotten ones<br>
The haters<br>
The sinners<br>
The daughters and sons

Where do we take this<br>
Which way to go<br>
We need to stop hate<br>
We must change the flow

The world she is crying<br>
Shes down on her knees<br>
The people are begging<br>
Just one love please

And those are the words we all needed to hear<br>
As love wrapped us all in the change that we fear

One Love<br>
Keep It Going
