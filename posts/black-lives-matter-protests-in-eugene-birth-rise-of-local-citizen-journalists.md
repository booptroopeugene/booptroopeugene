In the wake of the George Floyd murder by Officer Derek Chauvain, there have been countless protests. There have been riots – there have been tears shed, glass shattered, but through it something stronger has risen. Something beautiful and so American that it deserves some much-needed recognition.

On Friday, May 29, 2020, a small group of people merged at the intersection of Washington and 8th Avenue in Eugene, Oregon. An area that is well known as the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge – very popular among the local skater crowd.

But on this Friday, WSJ would become the center of a very different sort of action. What was meant to be a peaceful protest in support of the black lives matter movement soon became a nightmare of rioting leaving local organizer, Clea Ibrahim at the forefront and scrambling to get the rioters to stop the damage they were intent on causing.[](<>)[](<>)[](<>)

But, what came from the riot was knowledge.

The Eugene Police Department sent the SWAT team down to the intersection during the riot twice, as was confirmed by witnesses and one homeowner whose house faces the intersection where a construction sign and dumpster had been ignited by an unruly crowd painting messages meant to remind Eugeneans of the atrocity that befell George Floyd on May 25, 2020 and the reality of police intimidation, abuse and corruption in the United States.

The following videos were taken approximately one hour after the riot crowd dispersed:

However, the issues do not end there.

Riot Night was when we first saw the emergence of some of the strong men and women who were willing to go out there and put themselves in the line of fire in order to serve their community.

Aside from Ms. Ibrahim, another wonderful young man chose to put himself out there to provide live feed footage to citizens so they could see what traditional media is not showing you: how the police are handling this issue.

Known as *Stoggrd* to his friends, and mostly having a background in entertainment and music, Eugene now has a strong ally in Tre Stewart; a young man who inspired by George Floyd’s death and wanted to see safety in his community chose to take to the streets so everyday people could see exactly what has happened.

In the week and a half, since he has gone out to film, he’s experienced an overwhelming amount of support from his viewers and regularly has viewings of 5-8k viewers on any given night. But, what makes him such a hero is how dedicated and committed he has become since being thrust into his new role.

Thanks to Tre’s work, we’ve been able to see the Eugene Police utilize militarized weapons on peaceful citizens, impose an Unconstitutional curfew on law-abiding citizens and teargas credential-carrying media from *The Register-Guard* and *Eugene Weekly*, respectfully.

This footage has helped to procure support from larger civil rights organizations such as the*Civil Liberties Defense Center*, who recently sent a Cease and Desist Letter for first amendment violations to the*City of Eugene*, as you can read at the following link:<!--StartFragment-->
