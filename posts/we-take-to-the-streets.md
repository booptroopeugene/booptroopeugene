We take to the streets

To get rid of the crooked ass police.

The brute squad who seem to think they’re so high above us all

The ones who forgot,

We the people, are the law.

So, united we stand – now they’ll topple and fall

And all the men and the kings

They’ll never rebuild this wicked

Empire of sin – not on our watch.

No, never again.
