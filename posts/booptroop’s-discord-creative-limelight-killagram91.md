I be smokin this spliff

Smoke floatin by

Catch a whiff

Make a wish

On a spliff

Fresh dish

Salmon radioactive

Hyper active attention recorder

Lord of the order

Two cheeseburgers and a large fry

Supersize me I’m ready to fry

Cannibal of words

Zoning status

Red line the whole city I’m not burnin nothin

Except this squad car
