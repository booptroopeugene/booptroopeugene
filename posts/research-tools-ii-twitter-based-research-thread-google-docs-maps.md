This is an era of DIY.

This is an era in which we are — and must be — the media.

This is an era in which we are — and must be — the documentarians, the historians, the curators of information.

Increasingly, and of necessity, we are using Twitter as means of quickly conveying and sharing literally life-and-death information.

Tragically, a content alert applies.

Here are some resources for us.

**This is a map that interweaves Twitter data on police violence with geolocation mapping.**

(2) <https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1266752393556918273>

**This is the Twitter thread that started the various projects of compiling police violence videos into one archive.**

**This is the Google document that compiles in a linear, searchable fashion that data from** **(2).**

(4) <https://maminian.github.io/brutality-map/?ct=t(EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_4_6_2018_COPY_01)>

**This is the visualization map, which uses size of dots to indicate the number of cases in a region, based on the above data.**

As always, *BoopTroopEugene* is here for any research you conduct.

We will be glad and honored to share what you find.

We love you.
