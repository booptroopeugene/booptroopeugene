**Indefatigable,**

**tireless.**

**Uploading our evidence,**

**wireless.**

**Media,**

**medics:**

**Heroes.**

***Targets.***

**Supporting each other,**

**ignoring your markets.**

**You shoot us,**

**you gas us;**

**and yet, we return:**

**live streamers,**

**life savers;**

**our passion does burn.**

**You want us to trust you?**

**That’s something you have to *earn,***

**A lifetime of institutionalized**

**racist brutality to unlearn.**

**To undo, not renew.**

**To re-envision, not reform.**

**To make change that makes a difference,**

**not merely to perform.**

**We’ll hold your feet to the fire —**

**Hm, getting warm?**

**You can’t rain on this parade.**

**It can weather any storm.**

**A movement to abolish,**

**end racist murders and structures that bred them;**

**end the police unions**

**that too often let them.**

**Demilitarize,**

**so no other mother cries.**

**Prevent**

**mass media lies.**

***We* are the media now.**

**Surprise!**
