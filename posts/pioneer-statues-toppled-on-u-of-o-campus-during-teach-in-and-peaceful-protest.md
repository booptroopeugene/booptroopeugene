As we grow closer to the Juneteenth Celebration planned in Eugene, the Black Lives Matter movement continues to move forward with many local events, sit-ins, teach-ins, and protests to continue to shed light on the very real issue of police misconduct and brutality in Eugene.

June 13, 2020 there were two events occurring concurrently; one at Deady Hall by BIPOC Liberation Collective and the other at Alton Baker Park hosted by Black_Unity.

While these two events were occurring an unknown group took the opportunity to topple two prominent statues on the University of Oregon campus – The Pioneer Father and the Pioneer Mother. According to reports, the statue of the Pioneer Father was then drug to the steps of Johnson Hall.

It is still unknown what person(s) or group(s) are responsible for the toppling of the statues at this time and sources tell BoopTroopEugene that both Black_Unity and BIPOC Liberation Collective have denounced this event and continue to follow the motto to “disrupt not destroy.”

Isiah Wagoner of Black_Unity had this to say when reached out to for comment, “

“Black Unity had no part of defacing any property. We are a group of peace always have been, always will be.”
While advocating for Black Lives Matter, Black_Unity and BIPOC Liberation Collective fully intend to continue their peaceful approach, as they fight toward police reform in the Eugene-Springfield area.

UPDATE:

Since the posting of this article representatives from BLAC, Eugene Protests and Eugene Stand Up have confirmed that none of their organizations are affiliated with those responsible for the toppling of the statues.

They also strive to continue to support peaceful demonstrations, marches, and educational events to the public.
