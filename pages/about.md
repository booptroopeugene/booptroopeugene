We strive to provide real and ethical coverage of socio-economic issues, protests and educational awareness. 

It is our goal to assist in creating a better community for everyone in the Eugene-Springfield area. 

Proud to support Black Lives Matter, the marginalized and fostering a safer community for the youth of tomorrow by taking action today. 

Because everyone deserves to breathe and obtain justice. #booptroopeugene
